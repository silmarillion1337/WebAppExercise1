        <b>About</b><br />
        At a time when India was struggling for her freedom, oppression was rife and the press virtually gagged, one voice dared to break the silence. Founded by Shri Ramnath Goenka in 1932, The Indian Express gave India a voice of opinion that was fearless and true.

        From a single-edition paper in Madras in 1932, The Indian Express grew into a multiple-edition paper influencing thought and policy across the country. Packed with a fair mix of news, knowledge and information, The Indian Express hits the heart of the issue without any fear or favour. Reason why we have been identified with credible and fiercely independent journalism in India. Something we call ‘Journalism of Courage’.

        For over 75 years, The Indian Express has been read by those who have their own unique point of view of looking at things. With coverage based on comprehensive analysis, and with fearless reporting, we empower our readers with the truth behind every matter. We go the whole length to get to the crux of every issue. And we don’t just stop there, but ferret out every detail that brings out the how, why, where and what next of the subject. So, our readers can formulate their own stands on issues in a bias-free manner.

        The Sunday paper indulges the reader in news and views on people, technology, entertainment, business and books via The Sunday Express. With contributions from some of the most prominent columnists who offer an in-depth look at the week’s big stories. Moreover, with a newly re designed lifestyle magazine EYE, showcasing arts, films, travel, fitness, media, entertainment, social behaviour, spirituality and personalities, The Sunday Express truly stimulates the intelligent reader every weekend.

        A recipient of the prestigious IPI (in 2003, 2006 and 2009), Oberoi and ICRISAT awards, The Indian Express is known to go the extra mile and give voice to stories that otherwise go untold.
